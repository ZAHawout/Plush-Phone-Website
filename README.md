# Project Description

This project is comprised of a website that will be used for the sale of cell phones. The cell phones are called "Plush Phones". Three models of Plush Phones are available: Flagship Plush, Plush Luxe, and Plush Zenith Pro.

# Site Functionality

The website has the following functions:

    - A header at the top of the page that links to a modal form.

    - A carousel that showcases the three models of Plush Phones available.

    - Three images with "hover" functionality tha showcase the three models of Plush Phones.

    - A section that advertises the features of the Plush Phones.

    - A call to action "buy now" button.

    - A footer that also links to a modal form.

# Technologies Used

.html, .css

# Ideas for Future Improvement

    1. Higher quality images could be used (higher resolution).
    2. The website could be "filled in" a bit - it seems somewhat empty in some areas.
    3. A unified color scheme would make the website look more professional.
